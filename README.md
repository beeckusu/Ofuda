Attached is the demonstration of Ofuda. The game puts players into the position of a defending exorcist. A swarm of ghouls surround the
civilian base that the player must clear to keep the civilians safe. Players get a limited number of resources to work with to fight
off the ghouls. Can you survive the onslaught?
